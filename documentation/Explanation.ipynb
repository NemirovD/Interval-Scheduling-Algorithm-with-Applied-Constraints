    "Upon acceptance into university, first year students are expected to create their own timetable based on the courses required for their program. For a typical student, this is an extremely overwhelming process, leading to confusion and frustration.  Many students eventually abandon the process, opting for a less-than-ideal schedule, rather than to continue with the stressful task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of the stress is the huge number of options that a student faces.  The Fall 2015 Physics 1 course, for example, is comprised of 4 lecture sections, 28 tutorial sections and 42 laboratory sections.  Each student wishing to take this course must select one of each type of section.  There are 4704 combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a student does not just take a single physics course, so the number of possible combinations becomes outrageously high very quickly.  Couple the sheer number of combinations with the fact that many are impossible because of timing conflicts and a week 1/week 2 scheduling pattern and it's easy to see why students concede quickly in the search for a decent schedule.\n"
